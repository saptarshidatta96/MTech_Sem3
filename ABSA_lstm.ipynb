(or receptive to questions).\", \"The only complaint I have is that the tables for 2 along the booth are very close together so it wasn't as romantic a dinner as we wanted but all in all, we were in our own world, more like in heaven.\", 'Ok the manager did stand at the bar the whole time looking like his wife left him, he lost all his money at the track and had been drinking the rest of the day.', 'We complained to our waiter serveral times about this and the stares continued and to top it all off as the manager walked around to each table asking if they enjoyed their dinner, he

though).', 'however, we went for lunch and were the only ones eating there and yet the service seemed eager for us to be done and to get out.', 'Although the service was top notch, all of the food was disappointing: burnt octopus, bland ravioli, odd tasting mint love letters.', 'The portions were overly generous for both the apps and entrees without sacrificing the quality.', \"We arrived on a Thursday night at 6:30 and were seated immediately (they don't take reservations), but, this small place filled up very quickly, and the bar was overflowing with people when we left.\", \"The place was packed, but it didn't effect our service or getting our food/drinks promptly.\", 'The menu is slightly different from downtown, but they still have my favorites -- madai salad with hot sesame oil,

allow leisurely enjoyment.', 'SO I ASKED, TO SPEAK TO THE MANAGER, AND ONE OF THE OWNER WHO MANAGES THE PLACE CAME TO MY TABLE, TOLD ME THAT THE CEVICHE WAS FRESH.', 'It is far more popular as a bar

already paid for 2 rounds waiting for the table.', 'For example, we had ordered a 2nd bottle of red wine, the waitress gave me a new glass to taste the wine, but filled up my existing glass (mixing two different bottles in one glass).', 'As for the main attraction, the pies are known for their crisp outer edge and gooey middle, and feature the unorthodox layering of sauce over mozzarella.', 'The

that this place is so small that some seats are not made for a big guy.', 'No bar only a waiting area with about 10 tables where you can have drinks prior to dinner.', \"The hostess was condescending and the waiter was somewhat absent and unaccomodating (sure, we made a reservation to sit outside but when I asked to be moved indoors after I heard thunder he didn't even try to make it happen,

all--and even the most normal of groups love getting together for dinner and popular brunching on the palm-lined backyard patio spread.\", 'The waitress came to our table and told us about their tempting specials.', 'We asked the server for two glasses with a splash of Southern Comfort and Grand Marnier.', 'throughout the whole meal, all I kept thinking was AVERAGE, AVERAGE, AVERAGE until the bill came, which was a little more than average,to say the least.', 'We hung out by the bar mostly to ourselves, not an overwelming social crowd, but there were some georgous groups of hipsters looking like it was their meeting up before going out to the clubs (a few of the girls looked like top models), but the vibe was real chill.', 'The food is right out of heaven, arrive hungry because the portions are huge but not the prices.', 'Went to celebrate my sisters birthday on 9/11 was 1st taken back on the waiters rude answering of a question we had about the menu.', 'There is no bar so

restaurant like Craft needs to have much better quality food for the price they charge.', \"I would recommend going at off-times (before 7 perhaps) to avoid the crowds as it gets packed and there isn't much room by the bar.\", 'The service was polite, friendly and prompt, the characters walking around entertained the kids but werent intrusive to our meal.', \"If you've been out partying and have a yen for quality Korean food at 3:00am, there's a table waiting for you at Kang Suh Restaurant.\", 'And that is a shame as the restaurant is a pizzeria with a very limited menu outside of pizza.', 'The waiter just slapped my food down and then never returned until he slapped my check down.', 'The bartenders could have been a lot nicer but the drinks they shook up kind of made up for their poor attitude.', \"there's always people waiting to be seated and the chairs are not comfortable.\", 'Hillarious lighting and ecclectic side dishes make you want to love the place, but the meal on the whole was abyssmal.', 'The waiter returned seconds later to complain that dozens of people wanted our table then poured her beer into a paper cup-- presumably to encourage us to leave faster.',

price I paid to have dinner there, you would have thought I ate a horse.', \"All this Asian fusion craze leaves one feeling like they should've went to an authentic Thai or Indian restaurant for probably 1/3 of the price of Spice Market.\", 'I went with a friend from out the town - the best thing on the menu was the Veal.', \"The waitstaff is helpful and they'll get your favorite meats to circle your table more often if you just ask.\", \"One server came and gave us food that turned out to be someone else's.\", 'The food is not large and I could have had a few slices of pizza after I left.', 'Our experience consistently reflected a lazy attitude by the house towards cooking technique and customer care.', 'It appeared that they used a cheese pizza cooked earlier that day or the day before and just added the raw topping to it, then delivered it.', 'The wine did not come until we were half way through our entree and the waitress overcharged us by a bottle of wine.', 'service is good although a bit in your face, we were asked every five mins if food was ok, but better that than being ignored.', \"Enjoy the food, because it is remarkable, but don't be too willing to be
